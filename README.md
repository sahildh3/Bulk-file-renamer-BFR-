## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Open directly (works offline immediately)
Just open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).  
No build step. No npm. No server required.

### Option B — Serve locally (required to test PWA install)
Any static-file server works:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Node.js / npx
npx serve .

# VS Code — install the "Live Server" extension, then click "Go Live"
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and click the **Install App** button in the header.

> **iOS Safari:** Tap the Share icon → **Add to Home Screen** — standard PWA flow.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- **Zero data egress.** Files never leave your device; all processing is in-browser.
- **XSS-safe rendering.** Every piece of user-controlled text (filenames, rule inputs) is written via `.textContent` — never `.innerHTML`.
- **No analytics, no ads, no cookies.**

## 🔄 Releasing a New Version (PWA Cache Update)

To force existing installed users to download updated assets:

1. Make your changes to `css/styles.css`, `js/script.js`, etc.
2. Open `sw.js` and change `CACHE_NAME` from `'bfr-v2'` to `'bfr-v3'` (or higher).
3. Deploy. The old service worker will detect the new one, swap on next load, and the stale cache will be purged.
